# My personal web space
Some time ago I started thinking about creating a new web site in order to have my own space where to post everything I would to.

I decided to build it starting from zero, completely blank page at the beginning of the project.

I took this as a challenge because I've always avoid this type of programming: languages such as 'Javascript' or 'CSS' have always been critical to me. I've never feel confident with them and so this web site was for me a good test to try out and being a little more confident with those type of code.

## Structure
One of the most complicated part was to build a logical structure that should have been simple but functional. Finally, I reached this goal by divided all the source files of the site in different folder named by the extension of the file in the folder, and split the articles in different folder per year, and use a folder for each article. The final structure is something similar to the ones in the image below

## Server load
Pages are loaded from a script maden with php and Jquery
